# Introduction
### About Me
Hello, my name is Chris and I am a Software Engineer with a degree from Staffordshire University 
and 9 - 10 years of programming experience in multiple programming languages.  
I have worked in multiple industries such as: 
- Avionic Simulation and Aviation.
- Medical Devices.

### This Repository
I have created this repository so  that I can practice implementation of Blazor client side rendering
with my own web page, this website will serve as my platform for blogging, project updates and anything else
that might be interesting.  

### Future Work
My long term plan is to provide this repository with a web API allowing for dynamic updates to some of the content,
similar to a content management system.
